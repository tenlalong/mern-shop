A small little coding challenge

- The app should enable a single user to customize and submit an order for a t-shirt. The user can
choose between a t-shirt and a sweater.
The t-shirt comes in two materials: light cotton and heavy cotton (add $3 for heavy). The t-shirt also
comes in 4 colours, black and white are $16.95 base price, and green and red are $18.95 base
price.
- The sweater has only one material but does have color options: black and white are $28.95 base
price, and pink and yellow are $32.95.
- The user should be able to type in a string of text to add to the t-shirt. The first 8 characters are free,
but if it goes longer than 8 we'll charge them an extra $5 up to a length of 16.
- The app should function on both mobile and desktop devices. Once the user configures their t-shirt
you should persist their order on the server and allow the user to retrieve it even when they refresh
the page.
